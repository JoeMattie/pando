However, because we are still\\nbuilding out the final library touches, we feel it\'s the best version to keep them\\nuntil we are \\"feature complete\\" for the next month.\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nTo follow our progress this year, check out our [2022 Roadmap](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/projects/2). Our goal is to hit a solid alpha by end of September 2022.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### What are the goals of the experimental release?\\n\\nFor now, **experimental is just a creation phase.** What we are trying to do is very\\ndifferent than your basic UI library (MUI, Chakra, etc.). Libraries like these\\nare fine for startups, but at some point in time, lose flexibility on projects\\nor create **major tech debt problems** due to the nature of a component library\\ndepending on many other 3rd party libraries to exist. **Not to mention that natural\\nsecurity dependency risk this introduces.**\\n\\n:point_right: **This is where the PS Design Suite comes in.** :point_left:\\n\\nInstead of building another component\\nlibrary (which has been done a countless number of ways already), we are building\\na family of tools for you to create **your own library that better serves the\\nneeds of your team and project.**\\n\\nEach package serves a purpose that directly relates to the flexibility you want\\nto have in your project. You can use them as a single source, or you can combine\\nthem all to create an ultimate solution. It\'s up to you.\\n\\nAnd the best news is - **our packages are close to 100% dependency free** :tada:.\\n\\nNo more adding 5 additional dependencies just to use a single UI library. No more\\ngetting security issues in your project because X dependency within another\\ndependency within another dependency has a security bug.\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign: \'center\' }}>\\n  <iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/SACoDGYTvVNhZYNb5a\\" width=\\"480\\" height=\\"360\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n  <figcaption align=\\"center\\">Mindblown gif</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## Headless Styles\\n\\nWe have some new goodies for you:\\n\\n- **NEW** [Avatar](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/Avatar)\\n- **NEW** [Alert Dialog](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/AlertDialog)\\n- **NEW** [Text Link](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/TextLink)\\n\\nThat\'s right, we now officially have support that for inline text links! This\\nwill allow your apps to follow a better UI standard and provide great a11y\\nsupport for external links.\\n\\n## React Utils\\n\\n**We are very excited to introduce this new package for React users!** :tada:\\n\\nIn order to help reduce the code base and responsiblity for teams using React (or our [Headless Styles](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/intro) library), we decided to create [React Utils](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/react-utils/intro)!\\n\\n:::note\\n\\n**This library only requires the use of React.** You can use this library without\\nany of our other packages if you want to just improve the accessbility and UX\\nin your projects. :kissing_heart:\\n\\n:::\\n\\n**This library will deliver custom hooks and other utility functions that will\\nhelp you add accessible features for your components in React.** :atom_symbol:\\n\\n- **NEW** [useFocusTrap](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/react-utils/use-focus-trap): a custom hook for Dialogs/Modals that will trap the\\n  focus within your dialog when it is active and returns it back to the trigger\\n  that opened it when removed from the UI.\\n- **NEW** [useEscToClose](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/react-utils/use-esc-to-close): a custom hook that calls a function when the user presses the\\n  \\"Escape\\" key.\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign: \'center\' }}>\\n  <iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/70YaDoZ1VqBZ8SgYiz\\" width=\\"480\\" height=\\"378\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n  <figcaption align=\\"center\\">A woman saying \\"girl yes\\"</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n## PWA Docs\\n\\nAs of today, our docs site is **officially a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)!** :tada:\\nYou can now enjoy the experience offline or however\\nyou may choose.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nMore big updates to come including continued **features** in Headless Styles,\\nalong with some additional **refactoring**.\\n\\n- **FEAT** - HS: Add Tabs, Modal, and Menu\\n- **BREAKING CHANGE** - HS: The Button API will get an overhaul to be more flexible\\n  and deliver new styles (recent design change).\\n- **BREAKING CHANGE** - Tokens are getting a refresh to be more scalable and flexible.\\n\\n### Important\\n\\n**We don\'t anticipate any more API breaking changes after the next release**.\\n\\nThis is a very rare situation where we have one which actually justifies making.\\n\\nThe only reason we are shipping these now is that both Design Tokens and\\nthe HS Button API were our first packages/APIs built at the beginning of the\\nyear. Now that we are almost feature complete and have a better idea of the full\\npicture - we can make improvements now that will guarantee more success\\nfor the alpa-v1 phase.\\n\\n## Upgrading\\n\\n```bash\\n# npm users\\nnpm install @pluralsight/{headless-styles,react-utils}@experimental\\n\\n# Yarn Classic users\\nyarn upgrade @pluralsight/{headless-styles,react-utils}@experimental\\n\\n# Yarn Berry users\\nyarn up @pluralsight/{headless-styles,react-utils}@experimental\\n```\\n\\n## Installing\\n\\nIf it is your first time using any of our packages, check out our\\n[Installation Guide](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/getting-started/installation)\\nor any [Intro Page](https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/react-utils/intro)\\nof whichever package you are interested in using.\\n\\n**As always, if you have any questions or ideas, please drop us a thread in our\\n[Discussions Page](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/discussions).**"}]}')}}]);

## Using Themes

Pando ships with theme support using design-tokens that utilize a semantic naming convention. This means that our themes are created to scale and be easily used for both the design and developer experience.

```bash
# "usage" is the only required property

ps-[sentiment?]-[usage]-[prominence?]-[interaction?]
```

- **Sentiment** - "default", "action", "info", "success", "warning", "danger"
- **Usage (required)** - "background", "border", "navigation", "surface", "text"
- **Prominence** - "default", "weak", "medium", "strong", "inverse"
- **Interaction** - "default", "hover", "active", "visited"

What this looks like in terms of an actual token can be seen in an example of some of the tokens:

```css title="Example of tokens (not actual values)"
:root {
  --ps-border-weak: #000;
  --ps-text: #000;
  --ps-action-text: #fff;
  --ps-action-background-hover: #fff1;
}
```

## Adding styles and Accessibility

In Pando, our React library is responsible for styling components and making sure they are accessbile. We do this by using our Headless-styles library of Javascript helper functions that deliver the component props you need.

It looks something like this:

```jsx live
function ButtonExample() {
  return <Button sentiment="action">Action</Button>
}
```

This approach allows Pando to increase the performance of your application by relying on the use of Semantic HTML and plain JSX.

## Using Icons

Icons help enhance our pages and features. Our Icons library was created to provide icons for different solutions, including: React, Svelte, and SVG icons.

```jsx live
function IconButtonExample() {
  return <IconButton icon={PlaceholderIcon} />
}
```

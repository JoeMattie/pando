In order to provide an accessible user experience, you should design and develop date picking experiences to use an Input rather than a Date Picker.

## Calendar Picker vs. Input

### Date Pickers

Date Pickers are most useful for scheduling applications, where the user is selecting an unknown date with the aid of calendar context. They primarily benefit sighted users using a pointing device or touchscreen and most importantly **are not fully accessible**.

Despite what many articles claim, Date Pickers cannot be made accessible either. To learn more about why you should avoid using a Date Picker we highly recommend you read the article:

[Maybe You Don't Need a Date Picker](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/07/maybe-you-dont-need-a-date-picker.html).

### Text Input

The text-based Input is accessible by default and is easier use in most cases where the user needs to enter a _known_ date which applies to most applications and what we recommend using in Pando.

:::danger date Inputs are not accessible

Please note we are specifically using the `type="text"` input element and **not** the `type="date"`. This is because the date version of an input is (shockingly) **not accessible**.

## Text Input for Date Entry

In Pando, we recommend using the text-based Input combined with the [useAutoFormatDate](../../../reference/react-hooks/useAutoFormatDate.mdx) hook for displaying a way to enter a date.

In this example, we are creating a DateInput component that can be used anywhere in your application.

```jsx live showLineNumbers
function DateInput() {
  const formatOptions = useAutoFormatDate()

  return (
    <FormControlProvider>
      <Label htmlFor="date">Birthdate</Label>
      <Input
        describedBy="date:help"
        startIcon={CalendarIcon}
        {...formatOptions}
      />
      <FieldMessage id="date:help">
        Enter a date in the format of {formatOptions.placeholder}.
      </FieldMessage>
    </FormControlProvider>
  )
}
```

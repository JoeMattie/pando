title: Migrating from Classic
---

Coming from our Classic system? Pando is completely different. This means Pando **is not and will never be a 1:1 mirror to Classic**.

Classic was never built for a multi-product company and did not scale well. Pando resolves both of those issues.

### Utilities

:::danger Pitfall

Pando does not support motion or spacing tokens. There are enough studies that prove token usage of these properties depreciates performance when loading web experiences.
